### Understanding Classification & Clustering Problem

Hello! Here is a brief overview of what is classification and clustering and in what aspects do they differ from each other:

* Classification is a supervised learning technique used to assign pre-defined class (like 0/1, yes/no, true/false, etc.) to a data point on the basis of various features. Whereas Clustering is a unsupervised technique used to group similar data points on basis of various features.

* Classification algorithm requires training of data. Whereas Clustering does not requires trainng data.

* Classification assigns pre-defined labels whereas Clustering does not assign pre-defined label to each and every grouop.

* In classification problems the groups or classes are specified before hand, with each training data point belonging to a particular class. Whereas inn clustering the groups or clusters are based on the similarities of data points to each other.

* Classification algorithms are supposed to learn the association between the features of the data points and the class they belong to. Whereas in clustering no predefined output class is used in training and the clustering algorithm is supposed to learn the grouping based on similarity between different data points.

* Example of classification problem includes classifying of various credit card transactions into normal transactions and fraud transactions. While example of clustering problem includes recommending a movie because other customers who had made similar movie choices as us in the past have favorably rated that movie.
